    <h1>My books of 2020</h1>
    <p>At the end of last year I decided to quit social media, I closed by Facebook account and decided to use that time to read books. 
        One topic that got my attention was data privacy, and you will see throughout the year I've read many books on the topic.</p>
    <p>Most of the books I read I would recommend, and if not I will say it in the summary. </p>

        <h1>Thoughts on Ebooks Vs. Physical Books</h1>
        <p>This year I went back to reading eBooks, actually, quite a few of these books I read on my iPad. The main advantages are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I like being able to read in bed with lights out. I simply enable dark mode and I can read without disturbing my partner in her sleep</li>
                <li>I like that the books I read don't take any physical space at home</li>
                <li>I simply take the iPad with me and I'm able to read any book, so weight is not a concern (beyond the weigth of the iPad, of course)</li>
                <li>I like that I can highlight parts of the text and search within the book very easily</li>
                <li>Ebooks can't get lost, stained, or otherwise abused when traveling</li>
                <li>When moving to another city (which I've done a few times) I don't need to worry about the weight of books or what to do with them</li>
                <li>Ebooks tend to be cheaper than physical books, so there's a bit of savings there</li>
                
            </ul> 
        <p>The reason I prefer physical books in some cases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I actually like having books in my bookshelf. It looks very intellectual, although I think I need a second bookshelf, hence eBooks are good sometimes</li>
                <li>When it comes to learning I think it's better to have a physical book. For me, it's simpler to go back and forth, look at the index, find the page, etc. It's easier for reference. If I could combine that with an electronic search like in an eBook that would be awesome, but still a few years away, I guess</li>
                <li>I can support a local business by buying in local bookstores. I'll only order from Amazon when I can't find the book locally, even if Amazon is cheaper</li>
            </ul> 
        <p>Of course it's a matter of preference, however, a few years ago I sweared off eBooks because I didn't feel like the content "stuck" as much as with a physical book. There's <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kindle-nook-e-reader-books-the-best-way-to-read/"> research that suggests physical books are better for memorizing the content</a>. I convinced myself eBooks were not the way to go. Actually today in 2020, after doing a quick search (in DuckDuckGo, of course) I cannot find any recent studies on the topic. In any case, from these books some were physical and some were electronic. I enjoyed reading both and in order to boost my memory and keep an idea log I started this page.</p>
