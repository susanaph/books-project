    <h1>My Books of 2020</h1>
    <p>Last year, I watched the documentary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX8GxLP1FHo">The Great Hack</a> and decided to quit Facebook. For some time I had been thinking of it, as I didn't find it fun or meaningful anymore. Also, I wanted to learn more about data privacy. I decided to read more in topics outside my profession (management, Human Resources, etc.), as for the past few years most of my reading was for school or work. I was able to dive into the topic of data privacy and I wanted to briefly recap every book I've read this year. A few of these are slightly work-related, but have a few take aways that can be applied everywhere. <br><br>
    Most of the books I read I would recommend, and if not I will say it in the summary. </p>

        <h1>Thoughts on Ebooks Vs. Physical Books</h1>
        <p>This year I went back to reading eBooks, actually, quite a few of these books I read on my iPad. The main advantages are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I like being able to read in bed with lights out. I simply enable dark mode and I can read without disturbing my partner in her sleep</li>
                <li>I like that the books I read don't take any physical space at home</li>
                <li>I simply take the iPad with me and I'm able to read any book, so weight is not a concern (beyond the weigth of the iPad, of course)</li>
                <li>I like that I can highlight parts of the text and search within the book very easily</li>
                <li>Ebooks can't get lost, stained, or otherwise abused when traveling</li>
                <li>When moving to another city (which I've done a few times) I don't need to worry about the weight of books or what to do with them</li>
                <li>Ebooks tend to be cheaper than physical books, so there are some savings there</li>
                
            </ul> 
        <p>The reasons I prefer physical books:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I actually like having books in my bookshelf. It looks very intellectual, although I think I need a second bookshelf, hence eBooks are good sometimes</li>
                <li>When it comes to learning I think it's better to have a physical book. For me, it's simpler to go back and forth, look at the index, find the page, etc. It's easier for reference. If I could combine that with an electronic search like in an eBook that would be awesome, but still a few years away, I guess</li>
                <li>I can support a local business by buying in local bookstores. I'll only order from Amazon when I can't find the book locally, even if Amazon is cheaper</li>
            </ul> 
        <p>Of course it's a matter of preference, however, a few years ago I sweared off eBooks because I didn't feel like the content "stuck" as much as with a physical book. There's <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kindle-nook-e-reader-books-the-best-way-to-read/"> research that suggests physical books are better for memorizing the content</a>. I convinced myself eBooks were not the way to go. Actually today in 2020, after doing a quick search (in DuckDuckGo, of course) I cannot find any recent studies on the topic. In any case, from the books mentioned above, some were physical and some were electronic. I enjoyed reading both and, in order to boost my memory and keep an idea log, I started this page.</p>
